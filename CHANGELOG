---------------------------------------------------------------------------
30/6  2020 2.7.1    Compressing man-page with gzip --no-name for
                    reproducibility. Updated NTLDR bootstrap code and program
                    messages/text files to NT5.2 from from Windows 7/8/10.
                    Update EXFAT backup VBR/BPB when writing partition information
                    to preserve consistency across the entire boot record.

28/6  2020 2.7.0    Official development release with 2.6.x patches.

28/4  2020 2.6.2    Improved partition device and start sector detection on
                    FreeBSD. Implemented full support for OpenBSD by adding
                    missing code for disk and partition information detection
                    and enabled smart select which wasn't functional.

19/4  2020 2.6.1    Added support to run on macOS/OS X
                    Added NT6.0 FAT32 boot record (Win7/8/10)
                    Added NT6.0 EXFAT boot record (Win8/10)
                    Updated partition information feature for EXFAT and
                    NTFS and also enabled missing FAT16 support.
                    Added X/Open7 POSIX.1-2008 definition to prevent
                    compile warnings in identify.c and exfat.c source
                    code caused by the fileno function.
                    Removed support to alter OEM ID of NTFS boot records
                    since this makes for an unmountable partition.
                    Fixed error in Makefile where debug build didn't work.
                    Changed Makefile to support install on Mac/BSD/Linux.
                    Updated french, german and swedish man pages.
                    Updated french, german and swedish po files.

17/3  2019 2.6.0    No changes, only marked as stable version.

27/2  2016 2.5.3    Added french man page and translation.

16/1  2016 2.5.2    Added german man page,
                    added support for Grub2 and Grub4Dos MBR,
                    added support for KolibriOS MBR and FAT32 boot record,
                    added support for ReactOS MBR, FAT32 and FAT16 BR,
                    added support for Rufus MBR,
                    added experimental support for large sectors ( > 512),
                    now possible to alter OEM ID of FAT and NTFS boot records.
                    now possible to alter Windows Disk Signature in MBR.

26/9  2015 2.5.1    Added support to run on OpenBSD,
                    added german translation.

 5/1  2015 2.5.0    Added support to run on FreeBSD.

 1/1  2015 2.4.1    Added support for FAT32 PE boot record.

24/5  2014 2.4.0    Added support for syslinux GPT MBR.
                    Updated syslinux mbr to version 6.02.

 1/4  2012 2.3.0    Added experimental support for NTFS boot record. This
                    functionality is mostly useful to identify Windows 7 NTFS
                    boot records. Writing an NTFS Windows 7 boot record will
                    most likely not be of much use.

22/1  2011 2.2.1    Modified Makefile to recreate directories lost by CVS
                    Now also doing a sanity check before only writing BPB

13/5  2010 2.2.0    Added support for large disk image files. This version
                    is now considered stable as the BPB problem has had a
                    workaround since version 2.1.5.

14/3  2010 2.1.5    Added support for manually setting the number of heads
                    in BPB

3/10  2009 2.1.4    Win 7 and Vista MBR added
                    Added copyright notice to source files

30/12 2007 2.1.3    Makefile now supports DESTDIR

20/11 2005 2.1.2    Corrected spelling of Gürkan Sengün in man-page and
                    CONTRIBUTORS file.
                    Added a FAQ.
                    Renamed sv_SE.po to sv.po to fix bug described at
                    http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=336813
                    FreeDOS FAT16 and FAT32 boot records added.

3/8  2005  2.1.1    Now the -p switch also writes the number of heads in BPB.
                    Modified Makefile to work with newer version of gcc.
                    Unfortunately it no longer works with older versions of 
                    gcc as the output from the switch -MM has changed.

26/6 2005  2.1.0    Now ms-sys is able to identify an ms-dos MBR with the
                    undocumented F2 instruction.
                    Fixed bug in Makefile which make Makefile fail to install
                    files unless target directories already exists.

5/6  2004  2.0.0    Now ms-sys should compile cleanly also with a 2.6 Linux
                    kernel based distribution.

21/3 2004  1.1.3    Added switch -p to write needed partition information
                    which might be missing when some format programs are
                    used. The program now supports command line switch
                    concatenation, i e "ms-sys -f2 file" instead of
                    "ms-sys -f -2 file".

16/2 2004  1.1.2    Unofficial contributed version with support for new
                    MBRs and better MBR recognition. Instead of completing
                    the work to make this an official release I choose to
                    merge it into my ongoing work.

4/1  2004  1.1.1    Now compiles even if libintl.h is missing
                    Replaced the -k switch with -l (--wipelabel) with the
                    inverted functionality. This functionality was also
                    implemented for FAT12 and FAT16.

20/9 2003  1.1.0    DOS FAT16 boot record added
                    NT FAT32 boot record added

23/2 2003  1.0.2    Documentation update, man-page added

9/8 2002   1.0.1    Fixed problem compiling sv_SE.po with newer versions of
                    msgfmt

4/8 2002   1.0      First public release. Documentation updated with
                    SourceForge addresses for web and email contact.

30/7 2002  0.9      First stable release
